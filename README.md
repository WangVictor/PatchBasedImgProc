# ImageRecovTrans

Image restoration (denosing, super-resolution, etc) and style transfer with non-CNN methods. The purpose is for my self-education of those fileds.

# Denoising

A simple implementation of the sparse representation based methods.

# Super-resolution

Two methods are tried: sparse representation/anchor neighborhood regression with jointly learned dictionary .

# style transfer

It is intended to implement the style-transfer methods proposed recently by Michael Elad and Peyman Milanfar, which is a non-CNN based method.
